## Smartbrain Front End

This application let's you detect faces by copying and pasting url's of pictures inside the detect field.

It uses the [Clarifai Face Detection Model Api](https://www.clarifai.com/models/face-detection-image-recognition-model-a403429f2ddf4b49b307e318f00e528b-detection "Face Detection Model") to detect.

You can register, signin and all your face detections will be saved and returned as entries.

I deployed this app on Heroku using the free plan. Therefore it can take a minute to launch.
